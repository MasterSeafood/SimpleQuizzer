Classification of Life
Naming system started by Carl Linnaeus
Different groupings:
Monophyletic: group sharing a common ancestor, nothing else
Paraphyletic: group sharing a common ancestor, left out some organisms
Polyphyletic: group not always sharing a common ancestor
Linnean system: environment →  looks → classify
Modern system: based on DNA
Classification of Life:
Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species
Terms and Questions
Terms: monophyletic, paraphyletic, polyphyletic, classification of life
Questions: 
Who developed the naming system?
What are the different groupings of organisms?
What is the difference between Linnean system and Modern system of classification?
What are the 7 levels of classification?

Species Definition and Naming
Species: a group of organisms that can interbreed and make fertile offspring
have found 2 million species on Earth
estimate that there are 5 mil to 20 mil of species on Earth
Species concept
Different definitions on what a species is
Morphological
focused on the body shape, size, and structural features
Pros: very simple
Cons: hard to decide how much variation is allowed
Biological
defined species based on if they can have fertile offspring
Pros: widely used by scientists
Cons: sometimes cannot be tested (fossils, asexual organisms)
Phylogenetic
focuses on evolutionary history of organisms
defines a species as cluster of organisms
need to show pattern of relationships
Pros: can be applied to extinct organisms (DNA)
Disadvantages: evolutionary histories not known for all species
Taxonomy: branch of biology that identifies/names/classifies species
Carolus Linnaeus: father of taxonomy, used binomial nomenclature
Binomial nomenclature
two part naming system
Format: Genus species
Terms and Questions:
Terms: species, species concept, morphological species concept, biological species concept, phylogenetic species concept, taxonomy, binomial nomenclature
Questions:
What are the different species concepts and their definitions?
What are the pros and cons of morphological species concept?
What are the pros and cons of biological species concept?
what are the pros and cons of phylogenetic species concept?
Who is the father of taxonomy?
How does binomial nomenclature work?
Species Classification
grouping organisms based on criteria
developed by Linnaeus
Heirarchical classification
using nested systems to organize organisms
Rank: one of the 8 levels of taxonomy (e.g. Domain)
Taxon: a specific name of the category (e.g. Eukarya)
Common ancestor: an organism that organisms are descended from
shows that organisms have the same evolutionary history
the farther the split is → the less related
Evidences of Relationships
Anatomy
study of organism structure
Similarities between birds and dinosaurs
large hollow bones
similar arrangement of hip, leg, wrist, and shoulder structures
feathers
Homologous Structures: structures shared among organism because they have the same ancestor
Analogous structures: structures shared among organism because they live in the same environment
Physiology
 study of organism functions (physical and chemical processes)
DNA
Genes: sections of DNA (long chains of molecules → nucleotides)
Phylogenetic Tree
illustrate relationships of organisms
Root: oldest ancestral species
Upper branches: present day species
Forks: when the ancestral species splits
E.g Hooved mammals
Artiodactyla
even number of hooved ties
specialized teeth and digestive system for eating plants
about 150 members
Bovidae
have horns
110 members
Cervidae
have antlers
40 species
Cervus: high branched antlers
Rangifer: broad palmate antlers
Importance of Classification
Pharmaceutical: looking for drugs, hormones, can use species producing natural proteins
Disease: can trace transmission of disease
can test treatment
Agriculture: increasing crop yields and disease resistance by crossbreeding
Conservation: identifying new species in need of serious protection
Terms and Questions
Terms: rank, taxon, common ancestor, evidences of relationships, phylogenetic tree, homologous structures, analogous structures, genes, nucleotides
Questions: What is the difference between rank and taxon?
What are the three evidences of relationship, and their definitions?
What are the similarities between dinosaurs and birds?
What do each part of a phylogenetic tree represent?
Give an example of a phylogenetic tree.

Kingdoms and Domains
Structural Diversity
diversity shown through variety of physical structures
Original: Plants, Animals
1860s: Plants, Animals, Protista
1930s: Plants, Animals, Protista, Bacteria
1960s: Plants, Animals, Protista, Bacteria, Fungi
1990s: Plants, Animals, Protista, Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea
Cell Types
Unicellular: organism only made of 1 cell
Multicellular: organism made of 2+ cells
Prokaryotic
oldest cell type
no membrane-bound nucleus
have ribosomes and flagellum, no membrane-bound organelles
Eukaryotic
1000 times bigger than prokaryotic
have membrane bound nucleus and organelles
Three Domains
Rank Domain was added because of Bacteria and Archaea
classified Eukarya as own domain for all eukaryotes
Dichotomous Keys
identifying species using yes/no questions
Dichotomy: a two pronged fork
must have appropriate choices for dichotomous keys
Characteristics of Kingdoms
Autotrophs: makes its own food, usually photosynthesis
Heterotrophs: consume other organisms for food
Asexual reproduction: found in all kingdoms
Sexual reproduction: genetic material from two parents combine for unique genes
